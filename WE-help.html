                            An internship is usually a very important part of a student’s
                             life. It gives them an in depth view of their future career and
                              can often make or break the future employees in any profession.
                               That’s why there are a couple of Do’s and a couple of Dont’s for
                                a successful work placement. In this article we will be giving you
                                 10 tips on what to do and what not to do in your work placement.

                                        An internship is a very important job as you are trusted with
                                        many tasks, and you have been allowed to be at that organization
                                        for as long as you need, while being taught and tutored. That’s
                                        why you should always be appreciative of the placement and to
                                            your employers. Thank them by sending them e-mails or giving
                                            them notes, but don’t do this too often, as it might seem overbearing  
                                    </li>
                                    <li style="margin: 30px;">
                                        Act Professional- Remember this is a professional setting and
                                        you must treat your fellow employees and managers with respect.
                                        It is expected that you behave professionally throughout your
                                        entire work experience, except for celebrations of some kinds,
                                            or at times when it seems appropriate.
                                    </li>
                                    <li style="margin: 30px;">
                                        Be Communicative- You should always ask supervisors or fellow employees
                                        regarding whether they have a task that they want you to complete. Your
                                        time at the company is valuable, and you should try to get the most out of it.
                                    </li>
                                    <li style="margin: 30px;">
                                        wear the proper clothing, this of course goes without saying, you can’t walk into
                                        an office wearing baggy sweatpants with a stained shirt. This shows your employer
                                        that you do not care about this opportunity that they have given you and that you
                                        are not fully motivated. This can reflect badly on you for future careers as a bad
                                            review from your employer might deter other businesses from hiring you.
                                    </li>
                                    <li style="margin: 30px;">
                                        Your main goal during your internship is to pick up as much knowledge and experience as
                                        possible, this is why you should make sure you should learn during your time there, you
                                        can do this through a number of ways, such as memorization, taking notes, taking pictures
                                        and asking questions. 
                                    </li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <u>Dont’s</u>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <p style="margin: 40px;">

                                        <li style="margin: 30px;">
                                            Staying quiet: You shouldn’t be afraid to ask questions about the work you are
                                             doing if you are feeling lost or confused, you should be opened to learning new
                                              things, and not shy away from talking to new and other people. 
                                        </li>
                                        <li style="margin: 30px;">
                                            Slaking Off: Take every moment to stand out and stand above the rest, this elevates
                                             you to a higher standing in the eyes of the Supervisor, and you get better reviews
                                              for future careers, because of this if there is a job opening you may be one of
                                               the first people that comes to mind.
                                        </li>
                                        <li style="margin: 30px;">
                                            Giving Up: If you give up on any project it shows your supervisor that you are not
                                             hardworking and are not motivated. This actively harms you, you should use all of
                                              your possible options, and when those are done look for new ones. However, don’t
                                               be afraid to ask for help every now and then, there is no shame in it, sometimes
                                                we all get stuck.
                                        </li>
                                        <li style="margin: 30px;">
                                            Stay in touch with coworkers to continue hearing about projects, industry developments
                                             or for leads on jobs. Talk to your friends back on campus, too. Explaining your
                                              internship to others may reinforce the lessons you take away from the experience
                                               and give you a greater appreciation of all you accomplished. By following these
                                                dos while avoiding the don’ts, you’ll possess the confidence to walk the walk
                                                 and talk the talk of an experienced professional. You’ll complete your internship
                                                  knowing how to feel comfortable in the workplace, how to effectively communicate 
                                                  in the office and how to leave your coworkers and supervisors with a positive
                                                   impression of you as a professional.

                                            No one is perfect. If a mistake is made, whether it is missing a deadline or omitting a
                                             person from an email blast, take ownership of the error. Offer solutions as to how you
                                              will rectify the issue and prevent others in the future.
